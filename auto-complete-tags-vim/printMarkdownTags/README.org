#+TITLE: Tag Tools

* yaml-tags-to-TMSU
This takes a directory as it's first and only argument.

It will print back the commands necessary to build tmsu tags that correspond to the YAML headers in markdown files.

Pipe this to bash.

** ListTags.R
This works identically to yaml-tags-to-TMSU, I wrote it first because I'm more familiar with **/R/** but it's a bit slow.

* yaml-parse.js
This takes a directory as it's first and only argument.

It will print out all the yaml tags, pipe this to =sort -u= if you only want the unique tags.

* tags-to-TMSU.sh
This takes a directory as its first and only argument, its expected that directory will contain both:

1. a =.tmsu directory=
   - or atleast be beneath one
     - It won't delete any =.tmsu= folders above it, only within that
       directory.
2. Have Markdown Notes within or beneath it.


This script operates within the specified directory to either build tags

* Working with Vim
** Yaml Tags
#+begin_src bash
imap <expr> <C-c><C-y> fzf#vim#complete('node ~/bin/printMarkdownTags/yaml-parse.js $HOME/Notes/MD/notes \| sort -u')
#+end_src

** Hash Tags
#+begin_src bash
imap <expr> <C-c><C-t> fzf#vim#complete('rg --pcre2 "\s#[a-zA-Z-@]+\s" -o --no-filename $HOME/Notes/MD -t md \| sort -u')
#+end_src

* node_modules
These are dependencies for the javascrit in here, so definitely leave them be.
